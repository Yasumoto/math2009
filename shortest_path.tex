% Since this a solution template for a generic talk, very little can
% be said about how it should be structured. However, the talk length
% of between 15min and 45min and the theme suggest that you stick to
% the following rules:  

% - Exactly two or three sections (other than the summary).
% - At *most* three subsections per section.
% - Talk about 30s to 2min per frame. So there should be between about
%   15 and 30 frames, all told.

\section{Weighted Graphs}

%\subsection[Short First Subsection Name]{First Subsection Name}
\subsection{Background}

\begin{frame}{Heavy Lifting}
  % - A title should summarize the slide in an understandable fashion
  %   for anyone how does not follow everything on the slide itself.

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    A \alert{Weighted Graph} is a graph that has a number assigned to each edge.
  \item
    This number can mean cost, distance, or response time.
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Different Lengths}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
	The \alert{length} of a path in a weighted graph is the sum of the weights of the edges of this path.
  \item 
	In a typical graph, the \alert{length} of a path refers to the number of edges.
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Example}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item      
	insert item here.
