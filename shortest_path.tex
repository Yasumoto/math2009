% Since this a solution template for a generic talk, very little can
% be said about how it should be structured. However, the talk length
% of between 15min and 45min and the theme suggest that you stick to
% the following rules:  

% - Exactly two or three sections (other than the summary).
% - At *most* three subsections per section.
% - Talk about 30s to 2min per frame. So there should be between about
%   15 and 30 frames, all told.

\section{Weighted Graphs}

%\subsection[Short First Subsection Name]{First Subsection Name}
\subsection{Background}

\begin{frame}{Heavy Lifting}
  % - A title should summarize the slide in an understandable fashion
  %   for anyone how does not follow everything on the slide itself.

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    A \alert{Weighted Graph} is a graph that has a number assigned to each edge.
  \item
    This number can mean cost, distance, or response time.
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Different Lengths}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
	The \alert{length} of a path in a weighted graph is the sum of the weights of the edges of this path.
  \item 
	In a typical graph, the \alert{length} of a path refers to the number of edges.
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

	\item
		What is the shortest path from $A$ to $D$?

\section{Dijkstra's Algorithm}
\subsection{Example}

\begin{frame}{Description}
\begin{itemize}
\item
	Discovered by Dutch mathematician Edsger Dijkstra (1930-2002) in 1959.
\item
	Find the length of a shortest path from the starting point to successive vertices until the terminal vertex is reached.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%% New Example
\begin{frame}{A to Z}
	\centerline{\includegraphics[width=3.5in]{weighted_ex_2.pdf}}
	\begin{itemize}
	\item
		Start with a, find the next nearest vertex.
	\item
		Length of ab is 4, length of ad is 2.
	\item
		d is the nearest vertex.
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{A to Z}
	\centerline{\includegraphics[width=3.5in]{weighted_ex_2.pdf}}
	\begin{itemize}
	\item
		Find the next nearest vertex by checking all paths that go through only a and d.
	\item
		The shortest path to b is still ab, with a length of 4.
	\item
		The shortest path to e is ade, length 5.
	\item
		b is the nearest vertex.
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{A to Z}
	\centerline{\includegraphics[width=3.5in]{weighted_ex_2.pdf}}
	\begin{itemize}
	\item
		We now find the third nearest vertex (checking only paths that go through a, d, and b)
	\item
		c can be reached by abc, and has length 7.
	\item
		adez has a length of 6.
	\item
		z is the next closest to a, and has a shortest path of length 6.
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\section{The Traveling Salesman Problem}
\subsection{Description}
\begin{frame}
	\begin{itemize}
	\item
		The \alert{traveling salesman problem} asks for a circuit of minimum total weight in a weighted, complete, undirected graph that visits each vertex exactly once and returns to its starting point.
	\item
		Applications in transportation, shipping, etc.
	\item
		The most 'straightforward' method is to examine all Hamilton circuits and select the one with least total length.
	\item
		Very difficult
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Approximation Algorithm}
	\begin{itemize}
	\item
		An \alert{approximation algorithm} is one that does not neccesarily produce the exact solution to the problem, but one that is deemed close to an exact solution.
	\item
		For instance, an approximation algorithm might produce a Hamilton circuit of weight $W'$ such that $W \leq W' \leq cW$, where $W$ is the length of an exact solution and $c$ is a constant.
	\end{itemize}
